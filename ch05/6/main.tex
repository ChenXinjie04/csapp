	\item For degree n, how many additions and how many multiplications does this
	code perform? \\
	Both operation perform n times.

	Floating point multiplication will use 5 clock cycle and floating
	point add will use 3 clock cycle. And this two operation cannot
	perform in parallel.
	\item . \\
	In 5.5 this the multiplication can be done in parallel with the
	addition, because the operand in the multiplication is not
	dependent with the result in last iteration.
