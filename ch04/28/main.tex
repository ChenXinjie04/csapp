	For a three-stage pipeline, we should have blocks A and B in the first stage,
	blocks C and D in the second, and blocks E and F in the third. \\
	$Throughput = \frac{1\,instruction}{(30 + 60 + 20)\,picoseconds} \cdot
	\frac{1,000\,picoseconds}{1\,nanosecond} \approx 9.09 GIPS$. \\
	The latency is 440ps.
	\item . \\
	The optimal design would be a five-stage pipeline, with each block in its own
	stage, except that fifth stage has blocks E and F.
	$Throughput = \frac{1\,instruction}{(80 + 20)\,picoseconds} \cdot
	\frac{1,000\,picoseconds}{1\,nanosecond} \approx 10 GIPS$. \\
	The latency is 500ps.
