	\item In light of analysis done in Practice Problem 4.7, does this code
	sequence correctly describe te behavior of the instruction \texttt{pushq \%rsp}? Explain. \\
	No, \texttt{pushq \%rsp} will store the value in \%rsp before decrement. But this code will
	store the value in \%rsp after decrement.
	\item How could you rewrite the code sequence so that it correctly describes both
	the cases where REG is \%rsp as well as any other register? \\
	\texttt{
	movq REG, -8(\%rsp) \\
	subq \$8, \%rsp \\
	}
