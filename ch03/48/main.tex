	\item \textbf{For both versions: What are the position in the stack frame for
	\textit{buf}, \textit{v} and (when present) the canary value?} \\
	For the unprotected code, we can see that lines 4 and 5 compute the positions of
	\textit{v} and \textit{buf} to be at offsets 24 and 0 relative to \%rsp. In the
	protected code the canary is stored at offset 40 (line 4), while \textit{v} and
	\textit{buf} are stored at offsets 8 and 16 (lines 7 and 8).
	\item \textbf{ow does the rearranged ordering of the local variables in the
	protected code provide greater security against a buffer overrun attack?} \\
	In the protected code, local variable \textit{v} is positioned closer to the top
	of the stack than \textit{buf}, and so an overrun of \textit{buf} will not
	corrupt the value of \textit{v}.
