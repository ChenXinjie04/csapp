Looking at the declaration labeled .LC3 we see that the two values are 0(0x00000000)
and 1077936128(0x40400000). Since the machine use little-endian byte ordering, the
first value gives the low-order 4 bytes, while the second gives the high-order 4 bytes.	
From the high-order bytes, we can extract an exponent field of 0x404(1028), from
which we can subtract a bias of 1023 to get an exponent of 5. Concatenating the
fraction bits of the two value, we get a fraction field of 0x0000000000000, which
can be shown to be the fractional binary representation of 0, to which we add the
implied leading one to get 1.0. The constant is therefore $1.0 \times 2^5 = 32$.
