	\item \textbf{The value of \texttt{CNT}.} \\
	The offset of \texttt{last} in structure \texttt{b\_struct} is 288. And we can
	infer from the assembly code below that the whole structure is 40-byte aligned.
	So the value of \texttt{CNT} is 7.
	\item \textbf{A complete declaration of structure \texttt{a\_struct}. Assume that the only
	fields in this structure are \texttt{idx} and \texttt{x}, and that both of these
	contain signed values.} \\
